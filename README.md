# ECE 736 HW 4
## Question 1
Using multiple low dynamic range (LDR) images, the code creates the camera's response curve and a single high dynamic range (HDR) image. 
The g function was solved using an online script that also took code from Paul Debevec's paper "Recovering High Dynamic Range Radiance Maps from Photographs".
## Question 2
Using the dataset "AutoMPG" from the UCI repository, the code attempts to predict the fuel efficiency using linear regression with Gaussian bases and L2 regularization.
## Question 3
Using the "crabdata.txt" file, the code attempts to classify two species of crab using logistic regression and linear SVM.
